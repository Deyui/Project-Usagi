          * Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for "fair use" for purposes such as criticism, commenting, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research. Fair use is a use permitted by copyright statute that might otherwise be infringing. Non-profit, educational or personal use tips the balance in favour of fair use.<br />
          <br />
          - This website and the images and resources that it uses has no negative impact on the original works<br />
          - This website is for educational, research and for the series promotional purposes only<br />
          <br />
          We made this website with the intention of educating others and giving them easier access to research about this topic since there are as far as we are aware no other services available that cover the newest information about this show in English. We do not own most of the resources used on this website. From our understanding this is all within the Fair Right Use, however if the copyright holders are in the opinion that it is not and want us to remove several resources, assets or even the entire website. Then we are more than happy to do so if they contact us at GochiusaTranslations@outlook.com or through a direct message at our Twitter @usagi_anime_ENG and will remove it at our earliest convenience. Please message us at the beforementioned contact information if you have any other concerns.</br >
          <br />
          We believe this website is within fair use because:<br />
          <br />
          - We consciously try to only link to trustworthy websites that we use ourselves privately and provide legal materials related to the show. In order to not hurt their reputation as well as their income.<br />
          <br />
          - The entire purpose of this website is to help promote this series for overseas users.<br />
          <br/ >
          - This entire project is completely non-profit so we will never add advertisements and accept any other kind of monetary income in any way with the exception of if the copyright holders directly contact us and give us an offer that do involve monetary profits.<br />
          <br />
          - In our opinion, this website has no downsides for the series, in fact, it is only positive as it gives them free exposure and encourages people to become interested and invested in the show and ultimately lead to more sales overseas.
